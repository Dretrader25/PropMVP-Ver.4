<p><b>Rates Remain Near 10-Month Lows</b></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The minutes from the July FOMC meeting, released August 20, offered little new insight for rate watchers, as the meeting preceded July’s pivotal employment report. That report showed substantial downward revisions to previous months’ job gains. This redefined the labor market narrative from resilient to cooling more quickly than previously thought—sending mortgage rates lower in the weeks that followed.</span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the next market-moving event will be Fed Chair Powell’s remarks at the Jackson Hole symposium on August 22. With markets already pricing in strong odds of a September rate cut, any hint from Powell that the Fed is not ready to ease policy could spark a reversal in mortgage rates.</span></p>\
<p><b>Impact on the Housing Market</b></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with modest rate relief, affordability remains a major hurdle for homebuyers. More sellers have come off the sidelines this year, but the buyer pool has not kept pace, leading to a growing number of listings and record price cuts. In fact, </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/july-2025-market-report-35470/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">27.4% of active listings had price reductions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—a new high in Zillow’s data since 2018.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For buyers who can navigate today’s affordability constraints, the market has become more favorable. There’s less competition, more inventory, and greater negotiating power. Zillow’s </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/market-heat-index-34054/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">market heat index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows 27 major metro areas have shifted into neutral or buyer’s market territory—three more than last month and a clear break from the seller-dominated markets of recent years.</span></p>\

<ul>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building permits issued in July fell to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 1,354,000</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (SAAR). That’s 2.8% below the revised June rate and  5.7% lower than a year ago.</span></li>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing starts increased to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1,428,000</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (SAAR) in July, up 5.2% from the revised June estimate and 12.9% higher than a year ago, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</span></li>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Single-family housing starts increased to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">939,000</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(SAAR) in July, increasing 2.8% from the June estimate and 7.8% higher than in July 20</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">24.</span></li>\
</ul>\
<p><b>What happened: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing starts increased again in July, mostly due to a slight rebound in multifamily construction</span><b>. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">While single-family starts also increased, the uptick is likely temporary. Slowing price growth, weaker than expected sales along with rising input costs are a drag on builder confidence. Permitting activity remains weak and points to sluggish new home construction. With so many homes already under construction, starts aren’t likely to rebound meaningfully. In July, single-family starts increased in the South. However, single-family starts are lower than year-ago levels in every other region. </span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The silver lining: mortgage rates have eased somewhat since May, which could help support home sales in the coming months.</span></p>\
<p><b>Why this matters: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many builders pumped the brakes on new projects this year. The total number of single-family permits in the first half of this year </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/homebuilding-2025-slowing-35424/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> below year ago levels. </span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite a small improvement in housing affordability this year, home sales continued to bounce along the bottom. The slower than expected home shopping season has caused the number of unsold new homes to accumulate, weighing on builder confidence.</span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://www.nahb.org/news-and-economics/press-releases/2025/07/builder-confidence-edges-up-in-july"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Association of Home Builders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the share of builders cutting their prices and the use of incentives are on the rise. In June, the median </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/data/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">price</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per square foot of new construction homes was down</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 1.5%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a year ago according to Zillow data.</span></p>\

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[\
<ul>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>July 2025 Rent Growth:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> National rent growth slowed to </span><b>2.6% </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">year over year, down from 2.9 in June. Single-family rents were </span><b>3.4% </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">higher than a year ago, while multifamily rents increased </span><b>2.1%</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during that same period.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />\
</span></li>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>July 2025 Rental Affordability:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The typical new renter now spends </span><b>29.9%</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of their household income on rent.The pre-pandemic average was </span><b>28.1%</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The income needed to comfortably afford rent is now </span><b>$82,873</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, up from $61,472 since the pandemic.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />\
</span></li>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Where Rents are Flat or Falling:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The number of large metro areas with annual rent declines or no growth nearly doubled from June. Year-over-year rents fell in </span><b>Phoenix, San Antonio, Denver </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><b> Austin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">; annual rent growth is roughly flat in </span><b>Dallas, Las Vegas </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><b> Orlando</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>\
</ul>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typical asking rents increased 0.1% in July, dropping the annual rent increase to 2.6%, a downshift from the 2.9% observed in June. The typical U.S. asking rent is now $2,072.</span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rents increased from June to July in 32 of the largest 50 metros, with New York, Hartford and Richmond showing the highest monthly increases. Meanwhile, rents fell the most on a monthly basis in Austin, Memphis and New Orleans.</span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to a year earlier, however, rents declined or were flat in nearly twice as many metros in July as in June. Rents continued to fall from last year in Phoenix, San Antonio, Denver and Austin; while annual rent growth in Dallas, Las Vegas and Orlando is barely perceptible, below 0.5%.</span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While increases in both multifamily and single-family rents continue to moderate, the slowdown is more pronounced for multifamily units. Multifamily rents increased 0.09%, downshifting from the 0.25% advance in June. Single-family rents increased 0.15% in July, a downshift from 0.24% in June.</span></p>\
<h2><b>What’s behind the cooling rents?</b></h2>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, more multifamily housing units are still coming on the rental market. Zillow expects multifamily completions to peak this year. At the same time, an increase in housing supply in the for-sale market has pushed vacancy rates higher, giving both potential home buyers and renters more bargaining power.</span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While renters have more options now compared to last year, increased supply is not the only cause for a softening rental market. A soft labor market with low hiring rates and job-to-job mobility is another likely culprit for slower-than-expected rental demand for this time of year.</span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, landlords are doing what they can to get lease renewals, which means more tenants are staying put. At the same time, those with vacancies are increasing incentives to attract new tenants. Last month, 36% of rentals listed on Zillow had a concession – the highest level on record for July. That share is up from 35% in June and almost three times what it was in July 2019.</span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The silver lining for property managers is that rental demand is generally more resilient than buyer demand in times of economic uncertainty. Rentals provide relatively better affordability and a lower upfront financial commitment. With builders already pulling back and less supply expected next year, this year’s softer rental market may be relatively short-lived.</span></p>\

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sellers cut prices on 27.4% of listings, a record high in Zillow data that stretches through 2018.</span></li>\
</ul>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home values fell in half of the nation’s largest markets over the past year. Shoppers who can afford a home are gaining leverage in negotiations — high costs and economic uncertainty have pushed their competition to the sidelines. Sellers are cutting prices at record rates to try and entice buyers.  </span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home values rose over last year in 25 major markets, mostly in the Midwest and Northeast. Demand is high — especially in affordable areas — but building restrictions put a damper on new and higher-density projects. Sellers have few options to move up to, and existing inventory is still below pre-pandemic averages in many metros. </span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, home values have fallen year over year in 25 markets — most of them situated in the South or West — restoring a tiny chunk of affordability lost in the early pandemic run-up in prices. In the South, builders have kept up with demand better, </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/pandemic-affordability-34904/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">easing price pressure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and giving homeowners options to move into. Buyers are likely still running into affordability walls in expensive western coastal metros like San Francisco and San Diego. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />\
</span><b></b></p>\
<h2><b>Price-growth divide linked to recent success of builders</b></h2>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home value appreciation is nearly flat at the national average, rising just 0.2% over the past year. Lower rates and low price growth have slightly improved affordability; monthly mortgage costs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1] are down $19 over the past year, but the typical payment is still nearly $1,000 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">per month</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> higher than before the pandemic.</span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, home values rose the most in the past year in Cleveland (4.7%), Hartford (4.5%), Louisville (3.9%), Detroit (3.8%) and Buffalo (3.7%). However, even these gains are modest compared to the rampant double-digit growth seen three or four years ago.</span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida and Texas, both former hot spots for housing demand and skyrocketing prices, are home to the major metros seeing home values fall the fastest. Annual declines in typical home values are largest in Tampa (-6.2%), Austin (-6%), Miami (-4.6%), Orlando (-4.3%) and Dallas (-3.9%). </span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affordability and access is gradually improving where builders have been able to keep up with demand, showing why building more homes is so critical. Metros where price corrections are steepest are among those with the largest increase in inventory compared to before the pandemic. All of these metros except Miami rank among the </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/pandemic-affordability-34904/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">top 10 for home building permits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 2020 to 2024. When demand for homes surged, builders were able to respond fastest in areas with fewer land-use restrictions. That gave buyers more options and sellers more homes to move into, freeing up existing supply. </span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New construction is slowing the growth of a nationwide housing deficit, but a gap of </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/housing-deficit-35317/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.7 million units persists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The underlying demand for homes is out there — at lower price levels. </span></p>\
<h2><b>Price cuts reach record high</b></h2>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sellers cut prices on 27.4% of listings in July, the highest share since Zillow began tracking this metric in 2018. Cuts are more common in the South and the Mountain region, and are less widespread in markets more favorable to sellers in the Northeast and on the West Coast.  </span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zillow’s </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/market-heat-index-34054/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">market heat index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows competition among buyers continues to decline nationwide, reaching the lowest point for any July since at least 2018. Now, 27 major markets are either balanced or in the buyer’s favor — three more than last month, and nine more than last July. </span></p>\
<h2><b>Listings linger unless priced right</b></h2>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homes are taking longer to sell than in recent summers, and the gap between attractive listings that sell and others that linger is growing. Listings that sold in July did so in 24 days, six days slower than last year but just one day longer than the pre-pandemic average for July. However, the median lifespan of all listings on Zillow is 60 days, four more than the pre-pandemic average. The gap between those two figures is the largest for any July in Zillow data, which began being collected in 2018. </span></p>\

<ul>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The median mansion costs less than $1 million in four large metro areas: Buffalo, Indianapolis, Cleveland and Memphis. </span></li>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The median mansion nationwide is worth more than $1.4 million, and more than $4.5 million in four major California markets.</span></li>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An entry-level 5,000-square-foot home, or a “starter mansion,” goes for less than half a million dollars in Buffalo. </span></li>\
</ul>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In four major markets, a home buyer can live like a king while spending like a prince. </span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A median mansion nationwide, defined as a home with at least 5,000 square feet of finished living space, is worth more than $1.4 million. But it’s below $1 million in Buffalo ($825,500), Indianapolis ($965,500), Cleveland ($995,200) and Memphis ($996,700). That’s less than California Bay Area buyers are paying for a typical home.</span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The days of finding a mansion under $1 million are fading. In June 2021, nearly half of all U.S. mansions were valued at less than $1 million (45.1%). Today, just 3 in 10 are (30.3%). And, of course, some cost hundreds of millions of dollars.</span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Midwest and parts of the South, relative bargains are available for buyers dreaming of space and status with a smaller price tag. In addition to the four metros where most mansions are under $1 million, mansions are less expensive than elsewhere in places like Cincinnati ($1 million), Louisville ($1 million) and Birmingham ($1.1 million). </span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But on the coasts, big homes come with an even bigger price tag. In San Jose, $1 million wouldn’t even cover the down payment on a median mansion, valued at $6.5 million. Other sky-high markets include San Francisco ($4.9 million), Los Angeles ($4.7 million) and San Diego ($4.6 million). Outside of California, mansions are most expensive in Miami ($3.7 million), Seattle ($3.3 million) and Phoenix ($2.9 million).</span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atlanta leads in raw numbers with 21,634 mansions under $1 million — that’s 5% of all mansions under $1 million nationwide. The New York City metro area is second with 12,555, followed by Indianapolis (11,696), Washington, D.C. (10,613) and Chicago (9,530). </span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For buyers willing to make a few compromises in their fantasies, a “starter mansion” — a home in the 25th percentile of mansion values in a given area — goes for just a tick under $900,000 nationwide. In 21 of the 50 biggest metro areas, these starter mansions are available for less than $1 million. A buyer could even land one in Buffalo for less than $500,000.</span></p>\

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Zillow forecasts that rent growth measured by the Consumer Price Index will soften more quickly over the coming months.</p>\

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[\
<p><em>Update Following 08/12/2025 CPI Release:</em></p>\
<p><em>The July CPI release showed a mixed picture of housing inflation measures, though still within our predicted range and consistent with our long-term forecast.</em></p>\
<p><em>Seasonally-adjusted CPI for Owner’s Equivalent Rent (OER) increased 0.28% slighty less than our expectation of 0.31%.</em></p>\
<p><em>Seasonally-adjusted CPI for Rent of Primary Residence rose by 0.26%, above our expectation of 0.18% .</em></p>\
<p><em>The second monthly acceleration in rents paid was relatively small compared to the overall downward trend. Since April, the rate of rent inflation has dropped by more than a full percentage point. Housing has become an important offsetting factor for tariff-related pressure on goods prices. Softening growth in market rents should continue to drag down measures of housing prices in the CPI over time.</em></p>\
<p>________________________________________</p>\
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New shelter inflation numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics are to be released on Tuesday, July 12, 2025 at 8:30 ET.</span></i></p>\
<p><b>Key Takeaway</b></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CPI housing inflation measures should moderate significantly through late 2025 and 2026, driven by a sharp deceleration in market rents over the last few months.</span></p>\
<p><b>The Forecast</b></p>\
<p><b>Owners’ Equivalent Rent (OER)</b></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owner&#8217;s Equivalent Rent, which measures what homeowners would theoretically pay to rent their own homes, is projected to have increased 0.31% in July 2025 (95% confidence interval: 0.18% &#8211; 0.44%), matching June&#8217;s 0.30% pace. However, we expect this measure to decelerate meaningfully over the coming months.</span></p>\
<p><b>Annual outlook:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We now forecast OER to end the year up 3.4% year-over-year, followed by a dramatic downshift to a 1.9% increase in 2026.</span></p>\
<p><b>Rent of Primary Residence</b></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rent of Primary Residence, which tracks rent payments, is projected to have increased 0.18% in July (95% confidence interval: 0.06% &#8211; 0.30%), down from 0.23% in June.</span></p>\
<p><b>Annual outlook:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We now forecast the Rent of Primary Residence index to end the year up 2.7% year-over-year, before decelerating sharply to a 0.6% increase in 2026.</span></p>\
<p style="text-align: center;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-35436 aligncenter" src="https://www.zillowstatic.com/bedrock/app/uploads/sites/37/2025/07/cpi-2025-07-table.png" alt="cpi table" width="534" height="230" srcset="https://www.zillowstatic.com/bedrock/app/uploads/sites/37/2025/07/cpi-2025-07-table.png 534w, https://www.zillowstatic.com/bedrock/app/uploads/sites/37/2025/07/cpi-2025-07-table-300x129.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px" /></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zillow has revised down its 2025 on-market rent growth expectations: single-family rental homes are now expected to appreciate 2.5% annually, while apartment rents should rise just 1.0%.</span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importantly, the shelter components of the CPI continue to increase at a faster pace than these on-market rent trends, reflecting not only new lease pricing but also rent changes for renewing and longer-term tenants.</span></p>\
<p><b>Methodology </b></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These forecasts are based on predictions from a model that makes explicit the relationship between on market rents (measured by the Zillow’s Observed Rent Index) and the shelter components of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). </span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The model incorporates:</span></p>\
<ul>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expected on-market rent growth (Zillow’s Observed Rent Forecast, ZORF) </span></li>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assumptions about how landlords adjust rents at lease renewal </span></li>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renter mobility rates, which determine what share of tenants face a market rent increase.</span></li>\
</ul>\

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attached, single-family construction — condos and townhomes — increased at twice the rate of detached, single-family homebuilding.</span></li>\
</ul>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Single-family permitting fell 6.3% in the first half of 2025, signaling a slowdown after a year of rebound. Markets like Jacksonville, San Antonio, and Boston led the retreat in permits, with each seeing double-digit percentage declines compared to the same period in 2024.</span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affordability remains a major challenge, especially for first-time buyers, despite slightly lower mortgage rates. Buyers </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/june-2025-market-report-35351/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are gaining leverage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but sales volumes are sluggish and inventories are rising across much of the country. Existing home inventory is now at a six-year high and exceeds pre-pandemic levels in many markets, forcing builders to increase incentives and reduce prices to maintain sales.</span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While permitting activity in 2025 remains 16% above pre-pandemic levels, it’s a step down from 2024’s momentum, reflecting shifting builder sentiment. Notably, more than half of the 50 largest metros are still permitting more homes than their pre-2020 average, but overall momentum is clearly weakening.</span></p>\
<p><b>Markets with the largest declines in permitting activity</b></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the largest 50 metros, Jacksonville, San Antonio, Boston, Denver and St. Louis have seen the largest pullback in total single-family permits issued in the first six months of the year, compared to last year. </span></p>\

<h2><b>2024: A Rebound Year for Homebuilding</b></h2>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homebuilding rebounded in 2024 after two years in decline, driven by builder optimism, easing mortgage rates, low resale inventory and a </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/housing-deficit-35317/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.7 million-unit housing deficit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to address. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the ongoing housing affordability crisis, builders doubled down on </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/new-construction-affordability-34528/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their pivot toward more affordable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and more dense housing types. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Single-family starts rose 6.6%, while condo and townhome construction surged 10.7%, more than twice the growth rate of detached homes. This expands on a trend that </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/new-construction-smaller-homes-32892/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">began in 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/new-construction-affordability-34528/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continued in 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>\
<p><b>As the cost of space increased, lot size and home size shrank</b></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average size of new single-family homes shrank to 2,100 square feet, down 100 square feet from the year prior and 200 below the pre-pandemic average. Lot sizes declined even faster to 6,300 square feet, now 1,100 square feet smaller than in 2019.</span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Builder confidence was buoyed by limited resale inventory, mortgage rates falling from their 2023 highs, and an incentives strategy that kept new home sales rising.</span></p>\
<h2><b>Long-Term Affordability Tied to Underbuilding</b></h2>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Persistent underbuilding in expensive markets continues to erode affordability. Metro areas with high price-to-income ratios, such as San Jose, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, consistently permit fewer homes per capita than other regions.</span></p>\

</thead>\
</table>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past 12 months, metros with price-to-income ratios one standard deviation above the national average issued less than half as many permits per capita on average as their peers, locking in long-term affordability challenges.</span></p>\
<h2><b>Policy Solutions: Unlocking More Supply</b></h2>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Builders can only respond to demand where regulations allow. While geographic constraints can play an important role, zoning and permitting policies restrict housing growth in many cities. Tackling the housing deficit will require structural reforms:</span></p>\
<ul>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zone for more density: Allow multifamily, middle housing, and higher-density development.</span></li>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relax parking mandates: Lower costs and expand buildable area.</span></li>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streamline approvals: Reduce permitting delays.</span></li>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fund affordability: Expand trust funds to support affordable development.</span></li>\
</ul>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zillow survey data suggests most Americans support increased density in their own neighborhoods to ease affordability. The </span><a href="https://www.zillowgroup.com/build-the-middle/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Build the Middle” playbook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides guidance for removing regulatory barriers to more inclusive growth.</span></p>\

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[\
<ul>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">26.6% of for-sale listings cut their price in June. That’s the highest ever for June in Zillow data dating back to 2018. </span></li>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pandemic boomtowns like Raleigh, Nashville and Phoenix are among the nation’s leaders in price cuts. </span></li>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kansas City saw the sharpest jump in price cuts from May to June, rising five percentage points, followed by Buffalo (+3.9 pts), Indianapolis (+3.8 pts), Columbus (+3.3 pts), and Minneapolis (+3.2 pts). This can indicate a rapidly cooling market. </span></li>\
</ul>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After years of bidding wars, heartbreak, and sky-high prices, buyers may finally be getting a break. More than </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/june-2025-market-report-35351/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one in four home sellers cut their asking price in June</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the highest share on record for this time of year in Zillow’s data. </span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationally, 26.6% of active listings saw a price cut, up from 25.8% in May and 24.4% a year ago. More than a third of listings had their price slashed in markets like Raleigh, Nashville, Dallas and Phoenix — places that exploded during the pandemic, luring remote workers with open space, sunshine, and relatively affordable prices. </span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While affordability is keeping many buyers on the sidelines in some markets, other markets are seeing slowing growth in their local workforce. This is the group most likely to also enter the housing market as potential home buyers, and so demand in those markets is lessening, too.</span></p>\
<h2><b>The Facts</b></h2>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denver leads the nation in price cuts, with 38.3% of listings seeing a price reduction in June. Raleigh follows at 36.4%, with Dallas (35.5%), Nashville (35.5%), and Phoenix (35.5%) close behind. </span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of these markets saw explosive growth during the pandemic housing boom. Now, they are rebalancing as population growth slows and some buyers bump up against affordability ceilings. Nationwide, inventory is still 20.6% below pre-pandemic norms, but it’s already surpassed those levels in the five metros above, except Phoenix, which is just 2% below. </span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the opposite end, price cuts remain rare in markets like Milwaukee (13.9% of listings with a price cut in June), New York (15.6%), Hartford (16.0%), Buffalo (18.3%), and San Jose (22.1%). In these areas, tight inventory — both existing homes and new construction — is keeping sellers in the driver’s seat. </span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some metros saw especially sharp month-over-month increases in price cuts. Kansas City led the nation, jumping five percentage points, followed by Buffalo (+3.9 pts), Indianapolis (+3.8 pts), Columbus (+3.3 pts), and Minneapolis (+3.2 pts). A sharp increase in price cuts often indicates a rapidly cooling market. </span></p>\
<h2><b>Buyer Impact</b></h2>\
<p><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/market-heat-index-34054/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buyers are moving closer to the driver’s seat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as inventory climbs. In many markets, this is the first sign of meaningful negotiating power in years. </span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buyers should expect fewer bidding wars, more listings to tour and more time to consider their options. Seller concessions like rate buydowns may also be back on the table in some especially cool markets. </span></p>\
<h2><b>Seller Impact</b></h2>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the market rebalances, the days of never-ending lines at open houses are gone. Sellers are adjusting to this new reality and competing with each other as they try to elbow their way to the front of the line. Pricing and marketing a home well becomes even more important with fewer buyers in the market. </span></p>\
<h2><b>Looking Ahead</b></h2>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect more price cuts ahead. </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/home-value-sales-forecast-33822/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zillow’s forecast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for home values and mortgage rates calls for some affordability improvements by the end of the year, but not enough to move the needle for most prospective buyers. </span></p>\

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Zillow forecasts rates to stay near 6.5% through 2025, keeping affordability out of reach for most</p>\
<p>The post <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/fed-watch-july-2025-35411/">Fed Holds Rates Steady; Home Buyers Remain Stuck</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research">Zillow Research</a>.</p>\
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[\
<p><b>What happened?</b></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As widely anticipated, the Federal Reserve kept the fed funds rate unchanged in its July Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Chairman Jerome Powell said the decision is appropriate because while labor demand has weakened, so has labor supply, which keeps unemployment in balance. While the direct impact on mortgage rates remains uncertain, Treasury yields rose in response to Powell&#8217;s comments.</span></p>\
<p><b>Where will mortgage rates go from here?</b></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zillow forecasts mortgage rates will remain near the mid-6% range through the end of 2025. Mortgage rates continue to fluctuate with daily economic news, yet they&#8217;ve remained largely confined within the 6%-7% range over the past year. This persistent range reflects an ongoing tug of war: signals of a gradually cooling economy put downward pressure on rates, while stubborn inflation keeps them elevated. </span></p>\
<p><b>What does that mean for the housing market? </b></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect the housing market to remain stuck. Even if mortgage rates edge slightly lower by late 2025, it won&#8217;t significantly alleviate affordability pressures faced by the typical household. Zillow&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis indicates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mortgage rates would need to fall substantially—to the mid-4% range—to restore affordability for buyers earning the median income, an unlikely scenario in the near future.</span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With some buyers priced out, and sellers continuing to list their homes, inventory has </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/june-2025-market-report-35351/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accumulated to the highest levels since November 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Though prices remain high, the buyers still in the market find themselves with more options and more negotiating power. Aside from offering concessions like covering closing costs, sellers are cutting prices to entice affordability-challenged buyers. The share of listings with a price cut reached 26.6% in June, the highest share for any June in Zillow records dating back through 2018.</span></p>\

<ul>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasonally adjusted S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index® fell 0.3% in May.</span></li>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationally, prices rose 2.3% year-over-year in May, down from 2.7% in April.</span></li>\
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prices fell in May in both the 10-city index and the 20-city index.</span></li>\
</ul>\
<p><b>What happened: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seasonally adjusted national S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index (C-S) fell again in May. Released a month earlier, May home values measured by the  </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/may-2025-market-report-35283/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also fell on a seasonally adjusted basis – the first drop for any May since 2011. ZHVI has since shown continuing declines in June. Zillow now </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/home-value-sales-forecast-33822/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forecasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ZHVI to fall 2% in 2025.</span></p>\
<p><b>What Zillow Senior Economist Orphe Divounguy thinks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Zillow </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/may-2025-market-report-35283/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released last month, despite a return of sellers this home shopping season, sluggish sales led to a 20% increase in total for-sale inventory compared to the same month last year. As a result, the share of listings with a price cut </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">shot up to the highest May rate since Zillow started tracking this metric. In May, home values were lower than a year ago in 22 of the 50 largest metro areas.</span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/june-2025-market-report-35351/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tells a similar story. There were 1.36 million homes for sale in June — the most since November 2019. June price cuts set a record as affordability hurdles persist. A record 26.6% of listings saw a price drop in June — the highest for any June since at least 2018.</span></p>\
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While sales continue to bounce along the bottom, price adjustments could support a modest increase in sales over the coming year.</span></p>\
